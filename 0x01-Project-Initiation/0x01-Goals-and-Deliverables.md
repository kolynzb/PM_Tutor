# Introduction Defining project goals, scope, and success criteria

### Objectives

- Define and create project goals and deliverables.
- Define project scope, what's considered in-scope, out-of-scope, and scope creep.
- Explain how to define and measure a project's success criteria.

### Case Study

- Imagine your a lead project manager at **Office green**, a commercial landscaping company that focuses on making plant decor for offices.The director of product has a new idea called _plant pals_ to offer high volume customers small maintenance plants like little cacti for their desk.

## Determining Project Goals & deliverables

- We need a clear picture on what ,how and when you want to accoplish what and how to when it has been accoplished.
- **Project Goal**
  - Is the desired outcome of the goal e.g. the goal of the office green project could be to increase revenue by 5%
  - Well defined , clear and specific goals (better).
  - These also tell you what to do and how to do it. For Instance
    - "Improve the response time <u>via email</u> by 20%"
    - "increase revenue <u>through new service offering</u> by 5%"
  - Good goals are specific and measurable , great goals have even greater detail
  - Get details from stake olders and ask how the project goals tie into the overall organization goals and mission.
- After the goals we then have measure deliverable

- **Project Deliverables**
  - The products or services that are created for the customer, client, or project sponsor.
  - This is what gets produced at the end of a task, event or process .For instance launching the plant service and a finished website where plants with be displayed.
  - Help quantify and relise impact of project.

## Smart Method (_For Determining goals_)

- Full prove method to come up with robust goals to help you work smarter not harder

  <b style="font-size:19px; padding-right:2px">M</b><i>easurable</i><br>
  <b style="font-size:20px; padding-right:2px">A</b><i>tainable</i><br>
  <b style="font-size:20px; padding-right:2px">R</b><i>elevant</i><br>
  <b style="font-size:20px; padding-right:2px">T</b><i>imeboud</i><br>

- **Specific**
  - Goals that satisfy this should answer the following questions:
    1. What do i want to accomplish?
    2. Why is this a goal?
    3. Who is involved and who is the recepient?
    4. Does it have a specific reason, purpose or benefit?
    5. To what degree? / What are the requirements and contrains?
- **Measurable**
  - This helps track progress and keep teams motivated.
  - You can tell if a goal is measurable by asking how much, how many and how will i know when its acomplished.
  - Sometimes goals can be measured with a simple yes or no (_Did you learn the guiter.Yes_) but we need to measure our goals with _metrics_
  - **_Metrics_** - what you use to measure something _for instance percentage revenue is our metric_.
  - Consider benchmarks or points of reference inorder to determine accurate metrics._for instance if your goal is to increase revenue take a look at the figures from the previous year or data to decide how much revenue to . if the last year what 3% this year we want to increase it by 5% because of the booming economy_
- **Attainable**

  - Can the goal be reasonable reached based on the metrics.
  - Assuming you regulary run 2.5km and then your goal is to run 5k with in 4 weeks.An unattainable one is comming in 1st palce in a 5k when you can only run 1 km.
  - How can we know if a goal is attainable when its unfamiliar? A clue to answer this is to figure out how it can be accomplised for instance increasing your running distance by 0.5 km every week.

- **Relevant**

  - Does it make sense to try and reach this goal?
  - Think about how it aligns with other goals and values?
  - Is it worthwhile?
  - Is it the right time?
  - Is their an audience to use the project after delivery?
  - If there is a budget can the project be sustained after delivery

- **Time Bound**
  - Goal must have a deadline.

# Introduction to OKRs

- <b>O</b>bjective and <b>K</b>ey <b>R</b>esults.
- Like the smart method, OKRs help establish and clarify goals for a department, organisation or person.
- They take it a step further by combining a _goal_ and a _metric_ to determine a measurable outcome.
- **Objective**
  - defines what needs to be acheived
  - defines desired result and outcomes
  - _for instance , increase customer retention or improvement in employe onboarding process_
- **Key Result**

  - Measurable outcomes that determine when the objective has been met
  - _for instance, if your objective is to improve customer retention the KR is to achieve 90% customer satisfation rating by the end of the first quarter_

- You can use this to create _stretch goals_.
- Can be used on different levels of the organizaion.
  - Company-level OKRs are shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach its goals.
  - Project-level OKRs help define measurable goals. They need to align with and support company and department-level OKRs.
