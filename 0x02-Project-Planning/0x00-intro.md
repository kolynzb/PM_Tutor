## Objectives

- Kicking Off the planning phase
- Setting and reaching milestones and identifying tasks
- Budgeting process
- Identifying and planning for risks
- Documentation

> Before the Planning stage you have to go through the initiation phase that includes;

- Project manager gets assigned.
- Project Goals, Scope, and deliverables have to be approved.
- Team members get assigned.
- Stakeholder Sign off on your project charter.
- And after all this your set to start the planning phase.

# Planning Phase

- Benefits of planning include;
  - Understand the work needed to achieve your goals.
  - Coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors, and vendors.
  - Identify, mitigate and prepare for risks.
  - Get _"buy-in"_ from key members of the project team
  - Demonstrate to stakeholders that te team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan.
    > Planning together as a team , individuals assigned to the project can become a strong team.

## Launching the Planning Phase.

- 3 big things are worked out in this phase;
  - Schedule
  - Budget and
  - Risk management Plan

1. Schedule

- The timeline , which includes the start and end date,and dates for events in between.
- You will use time estimation techniques.

2. Budget

- This accounts for the total cost to complete the project.

3. Risk Management

- Searching for possible problems related to the project and planning ahead to mitigate these risks. _Risk is inevitable, but impact of risk can be controlled_

## Scheduling a project kickoff meeting

- Project Kick-off meeting
  - The first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roles within the team.
  - All members defined in the RACI Chart must attend (team,stakeholders,sponsor)
- We do this to;
  - Establish a shared vision
  - Align on scope
  - Build team rapport
  - Ask question s and offer insights
  - Set expectations

### Planning and running a kickoff meeting Agenda

- Intros
  - Team Member Names
  - Project Roles
  - Fun Facts
- Background
  - How the project came to be
  - Why the project matters
  - Set a shared vision
- Goals and scope
  - In-scope
  - Out-of-scope
  - Target Launch date
  - Milestones
- Roles
  - What work everyone is responsible for during the project duration.
- Collaboration
  - Shared project tools and documents.
  - Communication Expectations.
- What comes next
  - Set Expectations and action items().
- Questions

  - Gain clarity on meeting topics.
  - Ensure the project benefits from diversity of the thoughts experiences and ideas.
  - _Ask for confidence level, in order to build support_

- Document this in a meeting agenda.

#### Best Practices

- Ask teammate to take notes on key points and action items.
- Record meeting incase of large dispersed teams (_ask for permission prior to the meeting_)
- After the meeting, send a follow up email that summarizes the key points and outcomes from the meeting and any action items for attendees.
- In the follow up email, be sure to invite attendees to reach out if they have any additional questions.

## Understanding tasks and milestones

- There are two significant check points
- Milestone
  - An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. _for instance, completing the first draft of a report_
- Task
  - An activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. _for instance, ultimately publish the report_
- You must accomplish a tasks to achieve a milestone._for instance, if your milestone was to complete the first draft of a report the task would include hiring a writer,conduction research_

- Lets imagine these using plant pals. One of the project deliverables is to create a website where orders will be placed.
- Some of the milestones leading up to that launch might include securing approval on the web design and implementing feedback from user testing.
- To achieve these milestones the team must complete various project tasks.In order to reach the design milestone the designer must create mockups of the proposed website design,you will need to review the mock ups and the designer will implement your feedback.
- Milestones are important points within the project schedule whereas tasks are activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time.

## Importance of milestones
- Gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require.The further you break your project down the easier it will be to meet the project goals and better manage project work load.
- Keep project on track(_deadlines on milestones_).
- Help uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals.
- Reaching milestones can seriously motivate your tem, and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders.
- Great check in point to highlight progress to stakeholders.
- _Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order._
 - create design mock ups
 - develop website
 - carry out user tests
 - implement user feedback
 - These must be done in order , as the next task depends on the previous.
- Failure to complete a milestone in time sets your project back.

### Identifying milestones and setting deadlines
- 1st step to setting a milestone is to evaluate the project as a whole.Refer back to the project charter and make a list of the things to be done then get all the big things that indicate progress.
- To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teams to discuss the tasks required to reach the milestone, and get their estimates for how long those tasks will take.
- when determining deadlines for milestones, you'll also want to consider the needs of the stakeholders(_ask them when they expect to receive a deliverable_).

### Create a work break down structure
