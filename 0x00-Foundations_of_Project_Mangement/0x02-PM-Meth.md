    - Close the project
        - Celebrate and evaluate how project went.

## Core Tasks Involed in each phase
- Task 
### Project Initiation
- Define Project Goals
    - Define goals and deliverables
    - Research and Ideas
- Determine resources,people,and other project details.
    - A resource is any tool need to complete a project _ex. building,software_
    - This should be included in the project proporsal
-

# Introduction to project  management methodologies.
- _Project Management Methodology_ - is a set of guiding principles and process for owning a project through its lifecycle.And their two types of approaches.
    - _Linear_ means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start. _ex. this can work for building a house.. the blueprint is done before laying the foundation_. This includes a clear goal (_forintance you can switch to a flat if your building a bungalo in the middle of the project_).Have a clear sequential set of steps.
    - _iterative_ means some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen a the same time that other tasks are being worked on.This si more flexible. Deliver Complete parts of the pr0ject.

## WaterFall
- This is a linear approach which primarily focuses on the sequetial execution of phases that are clearly defined and .
- Complete one at the time like water flowing from a mountain.
- It was mainly used in disciplines like manufaturing and construction.
- Waterfall can be implemented when 
    - Their clear and predefines steps on how to go about the project.
    - When the changes  to the project are very expensive to implement once its started._ex. an event with a tight budget_
    - When they are tasks to complete before another can begin.

## Agile Methodology
- _Agile_ is a term to refer to flexibility or the ablity to move quickly and adapt.
- Its an iterative approach.
- Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations which in scrum are called __Sprints__
